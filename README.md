# css-practice
This was built by me following an advanced CSS and SASS course.

The course is called "The most advanced and modern CSS course on the internet: master flexbox, CSS Grid, responsive design, and so much more." and is available on Udemy. The instructor is Jonas Schmedtmann and more resources can be found on http://codingheroes.io/.

I highly recommend this class - the instructor is great at design and shows virtually anything that can be done with CSS. All the pages built in this class are purely html and css, no javascript.
